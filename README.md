## <a name="contributing"></a>Contribution 🤝

This application asks the user a series of questions and then inserts the answers within the generated readme file. However, it does not check for invalid inputs and it does not give the user option to choose the contents of the readme file. Contributors can help in resolving this issue.

## <a name="tests"></a>Tests 🧪

To run tests, run the following command:

```
node index.js
```
